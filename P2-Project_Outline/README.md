# Project Outline
For this assignment, you will submit a high-level outline of your project. This can, and likely will, change over time. In particular, your mentor will provide direction and feedback to help sharpen your ideas. So don't worry if you feel unsure about some aspects of the outline or if you have to change some things later.

## Submission Instructions

### Overview
My project will be a to-do list application that will reward the user for checking off tasks. It will allow users to create an account, create and edit tasks, label and view the tasks by categories such as Work/Home/School, and delete tasks by checking them off the list. When the user checks off a task they will see a congratulatory message rewarding them for completing the task. I would eventually like to have the user get rewarded with an incentive, like a treat or activity, but I'm not sure how that would work yet. 

The idea for this project came from the need of a family member with autism spectrum disorder to have extra encouragement to organize and complete tasks, but I think it could be helpful to anyone who has trouble with procrastination or motivation to get daily tasks done and feel better about accomplishing those tasks.
